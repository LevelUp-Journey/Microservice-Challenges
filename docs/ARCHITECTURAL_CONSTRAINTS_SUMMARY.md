# Architectural Constraints - Executive Summary

## Core Architectural Decisions

### **Microservices with DDD**
- **Bounded Contexts**: Challenges, Solutions, SolutionReports, Shared
- **Communication**: REST APIs internally, gRPC for CodeRunner integration
- **Data**: Database-per-service with PostgreSQL
- **Pattern**: CQRS for command/query separation

### **Technology Stack**
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 24
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate
- **Communication**: gRPC for high-performance code execution
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with SpringDoc

### **Quality Requirements**
- **Performance**: <30s code execution (95% of requests)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Security**: Isolated code execution environments
- **Scalability**: 1000+ concurrent users support

## Critical Constraints Impact

### **High Impact Constraints**
1. **Secure Code Execution**: Requires sandboxed environments and resource isolation
2. **Real-time Performance**: gRPC implementation with strict timeouts
3. **Data Consistency**: CQRS with eventual consistency across bounded contexts
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Institutional data isolation and customization

### **Operational Constraints**
1. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment mandatory
2. **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing and centralized logging required
3. **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage with automated pipelines
4. **Compliance**: Educational data protection (FERPA/GDPR)

### **Development Constraints**
1. **DDD Adherence**: Strict aggregate boundaries and domain events
2. **API Contracts**: OpenAPI specification as single source of truth
3. **Code Generation**: Protocol buffers for gRPC services
4. **Migration Management**: Schema evolution with backward compatibility

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **Technical Risks**
- **Complexity**: Mitigated by DDD principles and bounded contexts
- **Performance**: Addressed through gRPC and asynchronous processing
- **Scalability**: Container orchestration and horizontal scaling
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution and encrypted communications

### **Operational Risks**
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines with automated testing
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack
- **Reliability**: Redundant systems and circuit breakers
- **Compliance**: Privacy-by-design and audit logging

## Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions, evaluate against:
1. **Domain Alignment**: Does it support DDD and ubiquitous language?
2. **Quality Attributes**: Impact on performance, security, scalability?
3. **Operational Feasibility**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance implications?
4. **Business Value**: Alignment with educational platform goals?

## Evolution Guidelines

- **Technology Updates**: Spring Boot and Java versions tracked for compatibility
- **Scaling Events**: Monitor concurrent user patterns for infrastructure planning
- **Security Threats**: Regular security assessments and updates
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Continuous monitoring against SLA requirements
