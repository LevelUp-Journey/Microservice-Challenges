## Categories Summary

### **Architecture Style (ARC)**
Core architectural patterns and principles that define the system's structure.

### **Technology Stack (TEC)**
Specific technologies and frameworks mandated for implementation.

### **Quality Attributes (QUA)**
Non-functional requirements and quality standards to be maintained.

### **Operational (OPS)**
Infrastructure, deployment, and runtime operational requirements.

### **Business (BUS)**
Business rules, compliance, and domain-specific constraints.

### **Development (DEV)**
Development process, practices, and tooling requirements.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Reference**: Use constraint codes (e.g., ARC-001) when discussing architectural decisions
- **Validation**: Check constraints before implementing new features or making changes
- **Prioritization**: High-priority constraints (QUA-001 to QUA-004) must be maintained at all costs
- **Evolution**: Review and update constraints as business needs and technology evolve

## Critical Constraints Priority

### **ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Maintain)**
- QUA-001: Code execution performance
- QUA-002: System availability
- QUA-003: Security isolation
- BUS-002: Data protection compliance

### **ðŸŸ¡ High Priority**
- ARC-001: Microservices architecture
- ARC-002: DDD principles
- TEC-003: gRPC communication
- QUA-004: Scalability requirements

### **ðŸŸ¢ Standard Priority**
- All remaining constraints should be considered but may have flexibility based on context
