## Scenario Structure Analysis

Each scenario follows the standard quality attribute specification:

- **Source**: Who/what generates the stimulus (Student, Teacher, System, etc.)
- **Stimulus**: The condition that arrives at the system
- **Environment**: Operating conditions (normal load, peak hours, failure conditions)
- **Artifact**: System component being stimulated
- **Response**: System's reaction to the stimulus
- **Response Measure**: Quantifiable metric for verification

**Total Scenarios**: 18 across 6 quality attributes
**Coverage**: Performance (3), Reliability (3), Security (3), Scalability (3), Usability (3), Maintainability (3)
